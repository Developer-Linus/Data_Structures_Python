# Data_Structures_Python
- **Data Structures** are fundamental building blocks in Python that organize and store collections of data.
- Choosing the right data structure for my task is crucial for `efficient code` and `memory usage`.
## Common Data Structures
(a) *Lists*: Ordered, mutable collections of items enclosed in square brackets []. <br>
(b) *Tuples*: Ordered, imutable collections of data items enclosed in parantheses (). <br>
(c) *Sets*: Unordered collections of unique items enclosed in curly {} brackets. Useful for removing duplicates and checking element membership. <br>
(d) *Dictionaries*: Unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type. Efficient for storing data associated with labels. 
# Manipulating Data Structures
## Operations on Lists
### Indexing
- It is the process of accessing elements in a list by their position.
- It starts from 0 (zero) for the first element, 1 for the second element, and so on. 
- Use square brackets [] with the index number to access the element at that position.
Check `list_indexing.py` file for a demonstration of how indexing works.
### Slicing
- Allows the extraction of sub-lists from a list using **start**, **stop**, and **step** indices.
- The start index is **inclusive**, the stop index is **exclusive**, and the step interval is the interval between elements.
check `list_slice.py` for a demonstration.
